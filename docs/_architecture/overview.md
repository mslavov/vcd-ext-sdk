# Architecture Overview
The purpose of this section is to provide visibility into how things work under the hood. This is especially useful to people willing to contribute to the tooling, as well as people willing to extend it.
In this section we will cover the CARE package specification and its internals, as well as how the Extensibility CLI is built.
