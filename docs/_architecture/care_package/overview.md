# CARE Package Overview

Could Director exposes different extensibility mechanisms: UI plugins, Defined Entities, API extensions, etc. Each of those has its own lifecycle and management APIs, but in the real world they play together to implement more complex use cases and be used as part of a bigger solution. This makes building, distributing and deploying such solution a challenge. To tackle this problem we introduce the Cloud ARchive for Extensions (CARE) package. It is a package which contains the deliverables to be deployed, any configuration required, as well as the information needed to ask the user for how the package should be deployed.
